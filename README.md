The aim of the project is to provide an implementation of a recommender system based on collaborative filtering.
The technique is based on the user-item ranking. The similarity between objects is used to predict missing
user-item rankings.
In more details, this is how the technique work:
a) Users give ratings for some of the items.
b) Similarities between items are calculated.
c) The algorithm also takes into account the users who rated the same item to calculate similarities.
d) The system then predicts user-item ratings.
